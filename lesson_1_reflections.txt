How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    bug was introduced only when file was changed. viewing only the changes using diff command helped make it easier to spot the bug

 How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

 	having easy access to history of a file helps us see where we went wrong. most of the times we dont want to give current
	version to anyone as its unstable i.e. may be buggy while previous versions are stable.
	
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs 
having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

	pros 
	    meaningful commits
		commit when we want 
		google docs may have large number of "commits"
	cons
		person may forget to commit
		
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	because most of the software development projects are multiple-file.
	
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	using git log , we can see the various commits we made
	then using git diff we can find the difference between any two commits
	
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	because in git we have previous versions. so if we make changes that could introduce bugs, then we can easily go to previous version
	
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	i wanted to start a java project. i will use git while making it
